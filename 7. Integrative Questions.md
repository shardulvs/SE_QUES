### Question 7.1: Describe how version control and CI collaborate to ensure the flight simulator remains stable when adding features like emergency landing scenarios. Include branching strategies and testing workflows.

**Answer:**

**Version Control and CI Collaboration:**
Version control systems (VCS) and Continuous Integration (CI) work together to maintain the stability of the flight simulator software by managing code changes and ensuring automated validation of new features, such as emergency landing scenarios. VCS tracks changes to the codebase, allowing multiple developers to work on features without conflicts, while CI automates building, testing, and integration to catch issues early.

**Branching Strategies:**
For the flight simulator, a distributed VCS like Git is ideal due to its support for offline work and advanced branching capabilities (Slide 20). The following branching strategy ensures stability:
- **Main Branch (master):** Represents the production-ready code, containing stable releases (e.g., version 1.2.0 for the simulator).
- **Develop Branch:** Integrates tested features ready for the next release (e.g., emergency landing scenarios).
- **Feature Branches (e.g., feature-emergency-landing):** Created for specific tasks, such as implementing emergency landing logic. Developers work in isolation to avoid conflicts (Slide 7).
- **Release Branches (e.g., release-1.2.0):** Used to stabilize features before deployment, including final testing and bug fixes.
- **Hotfix Branches (e.g., hotfix-1.2.1):** Address critical issues in production, such as a bug in the emergency landing physics.

For example, to add emergency landing scenarios, a developer creates `feature-emergency-landing` from `develop`. Changes are committed locally, and the branch is pushed to the remote repository (Slide 18).

**Testing Workflows in CI:**
CI ensures stability by automating builds and tests upon code commits (Slide 23). The CI pipeline for the flight simulator includes:
1. **Code Commit:** When the `feature-emergency-landing` branch is pushed, the CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions) triggers the pipeline.
2. **Build:** Compiles the simulator code, ensuring the new emergency landing module integrates with existing components (e.g., flight dynamics).
3. **Automated Tests:**
   - **Unit Tests:** Verify individual functions, such as calculating landing gear deployment time.
   - **Integration Tests:** Check interactions between the emergency landing module and other systems (e.g., cockpit controls).
   - **Functional Tests:** Simulate emergency landing scenarios to ensure realistic pilot training outcomes.
   - **Code Linters:** Enforce coding standards for maintainability (Slide 23).
4. **Reporting:** CI provides feedback on test results. If tests fail (e.g., incorrect landing physics), developers fix issues before merging.
5. **Pull Request (PR):** Once tests pass, the feature branch is merged into `develop` via a PR, which includes peer code reviews (Slide 26).
6. **Pre-Release Testing:** On the `release-1.2.0` branch, additional system tests validate the feature in a production-like environment.

**Ensuring Stability:**
- **Frequent Commits:** Developers commit small changes to feature branches, reducing merge conflicts (Slide 23).
- **Automated Testing:** CI catches errors early, ensuring emergency landing scenarios don’t break existing functionality (e.g., normal flight operations).
- **Branch Isolation:** Feature branches prevent unstable code from affecting `master` or `develop` (Slide 21).
- **Traceability:** VCS logs (e.g., commit messages) track changes, aiding debugging if issues arise post-release (Slide 14).

This collaboration ensures the flight simulator remains stable, delivering reliable training for commercial pilots even as complex features are added.

### Question 7.2: Explain how software metrics (e.g., Cyclomatic complexity) can identify risks in the flight simulator project. For example, how might high complexity in the navigation module signal potential issues?

**Answer:**

**Role of Software Metrics in Risk Identification:**
Software metrics quantify code characteristics, helping identify potential risks in the flight simulator project by highlighting areas of complexity, maintainability, or error-proneness (Slide 27). Metrics like Cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, and function points provide insights into code quality and development challenges, critical for a safety-critical system used by commercial pilots.

**Cyclomatic Complexity and the Navigation Module:**
Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of independent paths through a program’s control flow, indicating code complexity (Slide 28, truncated content implies complexity metrics). For the navigation module, which calculates flight paths and responds to real-time inputs (e.g., GPS, air traffic control), high Cyclomatic complexity signals potential risks:
- **Calculation:** Suppose the navigation module’s flow graph has 15 edges, 10 nodes, and 1 connected component. Cyclomatic complexity is calculated as \( V(G) = E - N + 2P = 15 - 10 + 2 \cdot 1 = 7 \). A value above 10 (a common threshold) indicates high complexity.
- **Risks Indicated:**
  1. **Increased Error-Proneness:** High complexity (e.g., \( V(G) = 15 \)) suggests many decision points (e.g., handling weather changes, rerouting), increasing the likelihood of bugs, such as incorrect path calculations.
  2. **Testing Challenges:** Each path requires a test case, so a complexity of 15 demands at least 15 test cases, raising testing effort and costs. Incomplete testing could miss critical navigation errors.
  3. **Maintenance Difficulty:** Complex code is harder to modify, slowing down updates (e.g., adding new airports) and increasing costs for airlines.
  4. **Performance Issues:** Excessive conditional logic may degrade real-time performance, critical for pilot training realism.

**Other Metrics and Risks:**
- **Code Coverage:** Low coverage (e.g., 60%) in the navigation module indicates untested code paths, risking undetected bugs in edge cases (e.g., extreme weather navigation).
- **Function Points:** High function point counts for the navigation module suggest significant development effort, potentially leading to schedule overruns if underestimated (Slide 65).
- **Coupling Metrics:** High coupling between the navigation module and other components (e.g., flight controls) increases the risk of cascading failures when changes are made.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Refactoring:** Simplify the navigation module by breaking complex functions into smaller, modular units, reducing Cyclomatic complexity (e.g., separate path calculation from weather handling).
- **Enhanced Testing:** Increase code coverage through targeted unit and integration tests for high-complexity modules, ensuring all navigation paths are validated.
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools to monitor complexity metrics during development, flagging risky modules for review (Slide 2 references software metrics tools).
- **Documentation:** Improve code comments and design documents to ease maintenance, especially for complex navigation logic.

By monitoring metrics like Cyclomatic complexity, the flight simulator team can proactively identify and mitigate risks, ensuring reliable and maintainable software for pilot training.

### Question 7.3: Discuss how configuration management supports cost and schedule control in the flight simulator project, especially when managing multiple versions for different airlines.

**Answer:**

**Role of Configuration Management (CM):**
Configuration Management ensures that all components of the flight simulator software (e.g., simulation engine, aircraft models) are identified, controlled, and tracked throughout the development lifecycle (Slide 11). By managing versions and changes systematically, CM supports cost and schedule control, particularly when delivering tailored versions for different airlines (e.g., Delta’s Boeing 737 vs. Emirates’ Airbus A380).

**Supporting Cost Control:**
1. **Baseline Management:** Baselines define specific system configurations, including software versions, libraries, and hardware setups (Slide 10). For example, a baseline for Delta’s simulator specifies Boeing 737 parameters and cockpit hardware. By reusing baselines, CM reduces redundant development efforts, lowering costs when creating airline-specific versions.
2. **Change Control:** CM enforces a formal change request process (Slide 4). For instance, if Emirates requests a new turbulence model, the change is evaluated for cost impact (e.g., development hours, testing) before approval. This prevents scope creep, which can inflate budgets.
3. **Configuration Item Tracking:** CM tracks configuration items (e.g., flight dynamics module, pilot interface) and their versions (Slide 4). This ensures compatibility across airline versions, avoiding costly rework due to mismatched components (e.g., outdated hardware drivers).
4. **Reusability:** CM enables reuse of common components (e.g., weather simulation) across airline versions, reducing development and testing costs compared to building bespoke systems.

**Supporting Schedule Control:**
1. **Version Traceability:** CM records version histories in the VCS (Slide 14), allowing quick identification of the correct software version for each airline. For example, if Lufthansa reports a bug in their A320 simulator, CM retrieves the exact baseline, speeding up debugging and fixes, thus maintaining the schedule.
2. **Automated Builds via CI:** CM integrates with CI to automate builds for different airline configurations (Slide 23). This reduces manual effort and ensures timely delivery of tested versions, avoiding delays from configuration errors.
3. **Change Impact Analysis:** Before implementing changes (e.g., updated navigation for United Airlines), CM assesses impacts on other components and airline versions, preventing delays from unforeseen dependencies (Slide 11).
4. **Parallel Development:** CM supports multiple baselines for concurrent development (e.g., Delta’s and Emirates’ versions), allowing teams to work in parallel without conflicts, keeping the project on schedule (Slide 21).

**Managing Multiple Airline Versions:**
- **Custom Baselines:** Each airline has a unique baseline specifying aircraft models, cockpit layouts, and training scenarios. CM ensures these baselines are maintained separately but share common components (e.g., core simulation engine), reducing development time and costs.
- **Configuration Audits:** Regular audits verify that each airline’s simulator matches its baseline, catching discrepancies early to avoid costly delays during deployment (Slide 5, implied from NASA reference).
- **Version Control Integration:** Using Git, CM manages branches for each airline’s version (e.g., `feature-delta-737`, `feature-emirates-a380`), ensuring changes are isolated and merged systematically (Slide 18).

**Example:**
Suppose Delta requires a 737-specific emergency landing feature, while Emirates needs A380-specific weather handling. CM defines separate baselines, reuses the core simulation engine, and uses change control to estimate costs (e.g., 100 hours for Delta, 120 for Emirates). CI builds and tests each version, ensuring timely delivery without conflicts, saving time and budget.

By providing structure and control, CM minimizes rework, ensures efficient resource use, and keeps the flight simulator project on budget and schedule across multiple airline versions.

### Question 7.4: Analyze the interplay between risk management and project scheduling in the flight simulator project. How would a risk (e.g., delayed pilot feedback) affect the timeline, and how would you adjust?

**Answer:**

**Interplay Between Risk Management and Project Scheduling:**
Risk management and project scheduling are tightly coupled in the flight simulator project, as risks can disrupt the timeline, and scheduling constraints can introduce new risks (Slide 61). Risk management identifies, assesses, and mitigates potential issues, while project scheduling (e.g., via Gantt charts) plans tasks and dependencies to meet deadlines (Slide 68). Effective interplay ensures risks are anticipated and addressed to maintain the schedule, critical for delivering a reliable simulator for commercial pilots.

**Impact of Delayed Pilot Feedback:**
Consider the risk of delayed pilot feedback during the requirements validation phase, where pilots test the simulator to ensure realistic flight dynamics (Slide 9.1 from question set). This risk could arise due to pilot availability or scheduling conflicts at training centers.

- **Effect on Timeline:**
  - **Task Dependency:** Requirements validation is a predecessor task for design and coding (Finish-to-Start dependency, Slide 69). Delayed feedback halts these subsequent tasks, shifting the entire schedule.
  - **Critical Path Impact:** If validation is on the critical path (the longest sequence of dependent tasks, Slide 72), a delay directly extends the project duration. For example, a 2-week delay in feedback delays design start, coding, and testing, pushing the release date.
  - **Resource Idle Time:** Developers waiting for validated requirements incur idle time, increasing costs and risking further delays if reassigned (Slide 70, lag concept).
  - **Cascading Delays:** Delayed validation may compress testing time, risking incomplete verification of safety-critical features like emergency landings, potentially requiring rework (Slide 64).

- **Example Scenario:** Assume the Gantt chart schedules requirements validation for 4 weeks, starting January 15, 2026, with design starting February 12. A 2-week delay in pilot feedback shifts design to February 26, coding to March 12, and testing to April 9, delaying the release from May 15 to May 29, 2026 (Slide 68).

**Adjustments to Mitigate the Risk:**
To address delayed pilot feedback and minimize schedule impact, the following adjustments align with risk management and scheduling principles:
1. **Risk Mitigation Planning (Slide 61):**
   - **Early Engagement:** Schedule pilot feedback sessions early and involve backup pilots to reduce dependency on specific individuals.
   - **Simulated Feedback:** Use historical pilot data or synthetic feedback (e.g., from prior simulator versions) to proceed with preliminary design, refining later with actual feedback.
   - **Parallel Tasks:** Identify non-dependent tasks (e.g., developing the user interface) that can proceed during the delay, reducing idle time (Slide 69, Start-to-Start dependencies).

2. **Schedule Adjustments (Slide 68):**
   - **Fast-Tracking:** Overlap tasks where possible, such as starting design with partial feedback, accepting minor rework risk to compress the schedule.
   - **Crashing:** Allocate additional resources (e.g., more developers for coding) to shorten subsequent tasks, recovering lost time. This increases costs but maintains the deadline (Slide 64).
   - **Re-baselining:** Update the Gantt chart to reflect the delay, adjusting task start dates and informing stakeholders (e.g., airlines) of the new timeline to manage expectations.

3. **Risk Monitoring and Control (Slide 61):**
   - **Regular Updates:** Track pilot feedback progress weekly via risk reports, escalating issues to ensure timely resolution.
   - **Contingency Buffer:** Include a schedule buffer (e.g., 1 week) in the critical path to absorb delays without affecting the release date (Slide 72).
   - **Stakeholder Communication:** Notify airlines and training centers of potential delays, negotiating alternative feedback methods (e.g., remote sessions) to expedite validation.

**Example Adjustment:**
For a 2-week delay, fast-track design by starting with 80% validated requirements, allocate two extra developers to coding (reducing duration by 1 week), and use a 1-week buffer. This keeps the release on May 15, 2026, with minimal cost increase. The updated Gantt chart reflects adjusted start dates and resource allocations.

**Broader Interplay:**
- **Proactive Risk Identification:** Early risk analysis (e.g., pilot availability issues) informs the schedule, allowing buffers or parallel tasks (Slide 61).
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Regular risk assessments update the Gantt chart, ensuring alignment with current risks (Slide 68).
- **Feedback Loops:** Scheduling milestones (e.g., validation reviews) trigger risk reviews, catching issues like delayed feedback early (Slide 72).

By integrating risk management with scheduling, the flight simulator project can adapt to risks like delayed pilot feedback, maintaining timelines and ensuring reliable delivery for pilot training.
