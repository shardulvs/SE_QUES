### Question 8.1: Design a high-level architecture for the flight simulator software, including components like the simulation engine, pilot interface, and data logging system. Justify your design choices based on reliability and usability needs.

#### Answer:
The high-level architecture for the flight simulator software is designed as a modular, layered system to ensure reliability (critical for accurate pilot training) and usability (intuitive for commercial pilots). Below is the proposed architecture, followed by justifications for each component and design choice.

##### High-Level Architecture
The architecture follows a **modular, component-based design** with clear separation of concerns, organized into layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - **Pilot Interface Module**: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) mimicking a real cockpit, including controls (e.g., yoke, throttle, pedals) and displays (e.g., primary flight display, navigation display).
   - **Instructor Interface Module**: Allows instructors to configure scenarios (e.g., weather conditions, emergencies) and monitor pilot performance in real-time.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - **Simulation Engine**: The core component that models flight dynamics, physics (e.g., lift, drag), and environmental conditions (e.g., wind, turbulence). It processes inputs from the pilot interface and generates simulation outputs.
   - **Scenario Management Module**: Manages predefined training scenarios (e.g., engine failure, crosswind landing) and dynamically adjusts simulation parameters based on instructor inputs.
   - **Event Handler**: Processes real-time inputs from pilot controls and external hardware, ensuring low-latency responses for realistic simulation.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - **Data Logging System**: Records pilot actions, simulation states, and performance metrics (e.g., response time to emergencies) for post-session analysis and debriefing.
   - **Configuration Database**: Stores aircraft-specific configurations (e.g., Boeing 737 vs. Airbus A320) and simulation parameters (e.g., airport data, weather models).
   - **External Data Interface**: Integrates with real-world data sources (e.g., weather APIs, air traffic control simulations) for enhanced realism.

4. **Hardware Integration Layer**:
   - **Hardware Abstraction Module**: Interfaces with physical cockpit hardware (e.g., control panels, motion platforms) to ensure compatibility across different simulator setups.
   - **Real-Time Communication Module**: Manages communication between software and hardware, ensuring synchronized inputs and outputs.

5. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
   - **Error Handling and Recovery Module**: Detects and mitigates runtime errors (e.g., simulation crashes) to maintain training continuity.
   - **Security Module**: Protects sensitive data (e.g., pilot performance logs) and ensures compliance with aviation regulations.

##### Justification of Design Choices
1. **Reliability**:
   - **Modular Design**: Each module (e.g., Simulation Engine, Data Logging) operates independently, reducing the risk of system-wide failures. For example, a bug in the Pilot Interface wonâ€™t crash the Simulation Engine.
   - **Error Handling and Recovery**: Dedicated module ensures the simulator remains operational during minor faults (e.g., temporary hardware disconnects), critical for uninterrupted pilot training.
   - **Redundant Data Logging**: The Data Logging System stores data both locally and in the cloud (via External Data Interface) to prevent data loss, ensuring reliable post-session analysis.
   - **Hardware Abstraction**: Abstracts hardware specifics, allowing the software to run on various simulator setups without compromising reliability due to hardware differences.

2. **Usability**:
   - **Pilot Interface Module**: Designed to replicate real cockpit layouts (e.g., Boeing 737) with intuitive controls and displays, reducing the learning curve for pilots accustomed to actual aircraft.
   - **Instructor Interface Module**: Provides a user-friendly interface for scenario configuration, enabling instructors to quickly set up complex training scenarios without technical expertise.
   - **Scenario Management Module**: Supports customizable scenarios, allowing instructors to tailor training to specific pilot needs (e.g., practicing crosswind landings), enhancing training effectiveness.
   - **Real-Time Feedback**: The Event Handler ensures low-latency responses to pilot inputs, providing a realistic experience that aligns with real-world flying.

3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - **Scalability**: The modular architecture allows new features (e.g., VR support) to be added without major refactoring.
   - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns simplifies debugging and updates (e.g., updating the Simulation Engine without altering the Pilot Interface).
   - **Safety-Critical Compliance**: The Security Module ensures data integrity and compliance with aviation standards (e.g., FAA regulations), critical for pilot training software.

This architecture balances reliability and usability, ensuring the flight simulator is robust for continuous training and intuitive for pilots and instructors.

### Question 8.2: Create a flow graph for a flight simulator module (e.g., landing gear control) and calculate its Cyclomatic complexity. Discuss how this metric informs testing and maintenance efforts.

#### Answer:
The landing gear control module in the flight simulator software manages the deployment and retraction of landing gear based on pilot inputs and flight conditions. Below is a flow graph for a simplified version of this module, followed by the Cyclomatic complexity calculation and its implications for testing and maintenance.

##### Simplified Landing Gear Control Module
The module checks whether the landing gear can be deployed or retracted based on:
- Pilot input (deploy/retract).
- Aircraft speed (must be below a threshold, e.g., 250 knots for deployment).
- Altitude (must be below a threshold, e.g., 10,000 feet for deployment).
- Gear status (already deployed/retracted).

**Pseudocode**:
```python
function controlLandingGear(pilotInput, speed, altitude, gearStatus):
    if pilotInput == "deploy":
        if speed <= 250 and altitude <= 10000:
            if gearStatus == "retracted":
                deployGear()
                return "Gear deployed"
            else:
                return "Gear already deployed"
        else:
            return "Unsafe conditions for deployment"
    elif pilotInput == "retract":
        if gearStatus == "deployed":
            retractGear()
            return "Gear retracted"
        else:
            return "Gear already retracted"
    else:
        return "Invalid input"
```

##### Flow Graph
The flow graph represents the control flow of the above pseudocode. Each node is a decision point or action, and edges represent transitions.

          v
       [Check pilotInput]

 [Safe] [Unsafe]      [Deployed][Not Deployed]
    |      |               |        |
    v      v               v        v
 [Check gearStatus] [Return "Unsafe"] [retractGear] [Return "Gear already retracted"]
    |     |                          |
    v     v                          v
 [Retracted][Deployed]           [Return "Gear retracted"]
    |        |
    v        v
 [deployGear] [Return "Gear already deployed"]
    |
    v
 [Return "Gear deployed"]
          |
          v
        [End]
```

**Edges** (17):
- Start â†’ Check pilotInput
- Check pilotInput â†’ Deploy
- Check pilotInput â†’ Retract
- Check pilotInput â†’ Invalid
- Deploy â†’ Check speed & altitude
- Check speed & altitude â†’ Safe

- retractGear â†’ Return "Gear retracted"
- Invalid â†’ Return "Invalid input"

**Regions**: The graph has 5 enclosed regions (including the outer region).

##### Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation
Cyclomatic complexity (V(G)) measures the number of linearly independent paths through the program, calculated using one of three methods:
1. **V(G) = E - N + 2P** (where E = edges, N = nodes, P = connected components; P = 1 for a single program):
   - E = 17, N = 13, P = 1
   - V(G) = 17 - 13 + 2 = 6
2. **V(G) = Number of predicate nodes + 1**:
   - Predicate nodes: Check pilotInput (3 outcomes), Check speed & altitude (2 outcomes), Check gearStatus (2 outcomes for deploy), Check gearStatus (2 outcomes for retract) = 5 predicates
   - V(G) = 5 + 1 = 6
3. **V(G) = Number of regions**:
   - Regions = 5 (including outer region)
   - V(G) = 5 + 1 = 6

**Result**: Cyclomatic complexity V(G) = 6.

##### Implications for Testing
- **Test Case Design**: Cyclomatic complexity indicates the minimum number of test cases needed to achieve full path coverage. For V(G) = 6, at least 6 test cases are required to cover all independent paths. Examples:
  1. Deploy, safe conditions, gear retracted â†’ Gear deployed.
  2. Deploy, safe conditions, gear deployed â†’ Gear already deployed.
  3. Deploy, unsafe conditions â†’ Unsafe conditions.
  4. Retract, gear deployed â†’ Gear retracted.
  5. Retract, gear not deployed â†’ Gear already retracted.
  6. Invalid input â†’ Invalid input.
- **Edge Coverage**: Additional test cases may be needed to cover all edges (17 in this case), ensuring all transitions (e.g., from Safe to Retracted) are tested.
- **Boundary Testing**: Focus on boundary values for speed (250 knots) and altitude (10,000 feet) to ensure robust handling of edge cases.
- **Safety-Critical Testing**: Given the landing gearâ€™s role in flight safety, exhaustive testing is critical. High complexity suggests prioritizing automated tests in the CI pipeline to catch defects early.

##### Implications for Maintenance
- **Code Complexity**: A Cyclomatic complexity of 6 is moderate but indicates multiple decision points, increasing the risk of defects during updates (e.g., adding new conditions like hydraulic failure). Maintainers should simplify logic where possible (e.g., refactoring nested conditionals into functions).
- **Refactoring Needs**: If new features (e.g., emergency gear deployment) increase complexity beyond 10, refactoring is recommended to reduce maintenance costs and improve readability.
- **Documentation**: High complexity requires detailed documentation of decision paths to aid future maintainers, especially for safety-critical modules like landing gear control.
- **Change Impact**: Changes to this module (e.g., altering speed thresholds) require re-running all test cases to ensure no regressions, increasing maintenance effort.

In summary, a Cyclomatic complexity of 6 for the landing gear control module is manageable but requires thorough testing to ensure reliability and careful maintenance to prevent defects in this safety-critical component.

     - **Strategy**: Prioritize rigorous testing for emergency scenarios in the CI pipeline (Page 23).
     - **Action**: Use fault injection testing and increase code coverage for critical modules.

4. **Risk Monitoring and Control**:
   - **Risk Tracking**: Use a risk register to log risks, their status, and mitigation progress. Update weekly during project meetings.
   - **Monitoring Tools**: Integrate risk management software (Page 61) with features like risk notification systems and integration with scheduling tools (e.g., MS Project).
   - **Key Metrics**: Track metrics like number of unresolved bugs in critical modules, compliance audit results, and pilot feedback response time.
   - **Contingency Plans**: For high-priority risks (R1, R4, R5), maintain contingency plans (e.g., fallback to simpler flight models, extended pilot testing phases).
   - **Regular Reviews**: Conduct monthly risk reviews with stakeholders (developers, pilots, regulators) to reassess likelihood and impact.

##### Safety-Critical Focus
- **Accurate Flight Dynamics (R1)**: This risk is prioritized due to its severe impact on pilot training. Mitigation emphasizes validation against real-world data and pilot feedback to ensure models reflect actual aircraft behavior.
- **Emergency Scenarios (R5)**: Bugs in these scenarios could train pilots incorrectly, so mitigation includes extensive testing and fault injection to simulate edge cases.
- **Regulatory Compliance (R3)**: Non-compliance could invalidate the simulator, so early engagement with regulators ensures safety standards are met.

This plan proactively addresses risks, ensuring the flight simulator is reliable and safe for pilot training.
